> <sub> Cooperation is vital for human survival as it enables us to thrive in large groups. By living collectively, we can effectively collaborate and distribute tasks based on individual strengths, resulting in improved efficiency and productivity. </sub>


#### How many people in modern societies fight back and defend themselves when attacked?

> <sub> Example 1: Approximately 30,000 fighters from at least 85 countries joined the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which had very clear defined religious values. Around 6.6 million Syrians and 1.5 million Iraqis, as well as many from Lebanon, Jordan, etc., fled the area, with approximately 90% being young Muslim men. According to the Qur’an and hadith, fleeing from Jihad (war) is a greater sin and is considered the twenty-seventh sin. Additionally, the prophet of Islam said: “I disown every Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen” (Christians, Jews). (85,86,87,88,89,90,91) </sub>

#### Can monopolies of people without any shared value be considered a society?

This amounts to around 20% of the Ukrainian population (103) Per R. Klitgaard Since a high degree of monopoly and low degree of transparency does not automatically lead to corruption, a fourth variable of "morality" or "integrity" has been introduced by others.

## Multiculturalism: Does it lead to a tolerant and open-minded society or paralyzed parallel societies?

> Multiculturalism is often seen as a way to promote cultural exchange, tolerance, openness to other cultures, and new ideas. (110) However, there are also studies that show the opposite. Multiculturalism can lead to social tensions, culture clash, polarization, marginalization, and language problems.

> A bounded confidence model is a model of consensus-like opinion dynamics in which agents interact only when their opinions are close enough.(111)

> Free circulation of information, social media, and debates can lead to group polarization.(112)(113) 

> People with similar points of view tend to follow, share, and comment on each other’s posts. Discussion of racial attitude items with others having similar attitudes significantly increased the gap between high- and low-prejudice groups. Based on that, extremists who meet and interact with each other in a place get even more extremist, which can raise the gap of parallel societies. (114,115,116)

#### Can multiculturalism contribute to international inequality?

> <sub> Multiculturalism is essential for the survival of psychopathic economies and has huge economic benefits. </sub>

  <sub> Germany is the biggest winner. According to Brücker in 2013, without immigration, the labor force potential in Germany would fall by around 40% by 2050. (117) <sub>

#### Are the "Homeland countries" of migrants the biggest Winners, too?

> Immigration leads to a decrease in IQ in origin countries. Scotland has the lowest average IQ in the UK and performs poorly compared to most of Europe, according to studies.(119)

> Over 80% of intelligent students from top universities in third world countries migrate to industrial countries.(121)

> 77% of working people from a third world country are willing to migrate, according to a survey conducted by a Job Vision center.(120)

> Each young migrant in early working age costs their country of origin $120,000, according to international organizations.(118)

#### What are the benefits of cultural dialogue within a society?

> The exchange of ideas and debates lead to more polarization, as stated before.

#### How is tribalism fueled by polarization?

> The decrease in the percentage of people who take friends or marry someone with different political viewpoints reflects how social media has made the atmosphere so polarizing.

> Devout religious belief or observance is not a predictor of extremism. However, studies show that support for terrorism in majority Muslim countries is related to how often you pray in a mosque, not how often you pray or how devout you are about food prohibitions. The same is also true of right-wing Jewish extremists in Israel.

> Nationalism and tolerance for autocratic leaders are rising all around the world most likely as a reaction to globalization.
 
> Research suggests that it’s bad for everyone’s well-being when the rich don’t have contact with the poor or the poor with the middle class. (211,212,213)

#### Does having no defined values lead to moral collapse?

> Psychopathic democracies lead to corruption, which destroys the moral fabric of society. (122)
 
#### Can the voting app be used to prevent moral collapse?

**Creating the first Oversocieties?**

> If society 1, 2, 3, Christian, Hindus, Chinese, Islamic, and Atheists have a common value of no nuclear bombs, then all societies must comply

> If society 3 possesses and maintains atomic bombs, the oversociety must decide how to punish, isolate, or attacksociety 3-> Produce and Keep -> over society Decide to punish, isolate or attack.
 
> No priority is given to American, Western, Muslim, or African values to make decisions about the oversociety

#### How can international inequality only be solved in Oversociety?

> In the absence of corrupt politicians, all people have full power and can take action against a society that causes harm to others.

> Example: Society 6 start psychopathic economy leading to inequality, an aging population, migration, loss of working power, harm to families and children left behind, society issues, increased flights due to intercontinental families, and increasing polarization and inequality.
 
> Oversociety must decide how to proceed against this behavior as it causes harm to all.
