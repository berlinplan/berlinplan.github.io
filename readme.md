### Smarter smartphones, the cure for cancer, and the elimination of hunger in Africa, if slavery still persisted?

#### Benefits of slavery for World Development: (224)

> <sub> **1. The improvement of African lives:** The slave trade fostered international commerce between Africa, the USA, and Europe. Numerous goods were exchanged with Africa in return for slaves. These products were subsequently utilized within Africa to enhance the well-being of its people. Additionally, the slave market attracted increased European visitors who engaged in goods exchange with Americans and Africans. </sub>

> <sub> **2. Multiculturalism:** When different countries interacted, they exchanged their culture. This helped in building long-term relationships and developing nations. Besides, the slave trade also led to intermarriage. People from different continents intermarried to produce mixed races. </sub>

> <sub> **3. Free trade:** Slavery contributes to free trade by providing European farms with cost-free labor, leading to increased profitability and economic growth.</sub> 

> <sub> **4. Quick production:** Slavery enables industries to achieve rapid production as slaves efficiently contribute to the manufacturing process. </sub>

> <sub> **5. Economic stability:** By relying on enslaved labor in their firms, Britain harnessed the economic benefits of slavery, which served as a stabilizing force for the country's economy during the colonial era. </sub>

> <sub> **6. Transport system:** The transport industry developed rapidly across the Atlantic Ocean. This is because thousands of slaves would be transported each month. Inventors started making ships that would accommodate more people and goods. </sub>

> <sub> **7. Job security:** The master had to feed the slaves even when they got sick or became too old. This was the main reason why some people would join slavery voluntarily. Also, when there was no work available, the master had to feed his slaves for future jobs. </sub>

> <sub> **8. Exploration:** Slave trade was one of the factors that contributed to exploration in Africa, Europe, and America. Traders would explore new places each time they visited a different market. </sub>

> <sub> **9. Development:** Slave owners saved a lot of money as they did not have to hire employees. The slaves worked for free and only required food and medication. This helped the slave owners make more profits and maybe develop their areas. </sub>

> <sub> *Slavery was the engine of US growth (214).* </sub>

> <sub> *Colonization had a huge impact on development in Western countries (215).* </sub>

##  Blocking streets and increasing polarization to solve the environmental crisis, correct? 

> Can street blockades for Instagram videos and power struggles within the political system effectively address environmental issues?

or

> <sub> Would granting voting power to marginalized groups such as children & 3rd-world countries lead to equality, as granting voting power to African Americans reduced inequality? (223) </sub>

> <sub> Can human envy and voting power serve as a check on rapid development, leading to greater equality and environmental protection? </sub>

## Are e-cars good for the environment or bullshit for the environment?

> E-cars require ten times as many chips as petrol or diesel. Joe Biden passed the Chips Act to restrict the use of US technology in producing semiconductors. Technology producers prioritize profit, leading to poorer countries importing the technology. This creates a cycle of wealth inequality, where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. E-cars increase inequality (139, 140).

> <sub> While most 3rd-world countries have no roads, how much do luxury self-pilot e-cars, NASA space travel, or hi-tech super yachts contribute to the well-being of their citizens? </sub>

> <sub> Is it probable that citizens of the Middle East would rather see damaged streets, hi-tech drones, aircraft, satellite-run rockets, tanks, and military technology of psychopathic countries, or luxury self-driving e-cars? </sub>

##  #awareness #equality #woke #muslimlivesmatter, truth?

> <sub> Luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Gucci leverage their influential social media accounts to endorse #equality and #blacklivesmatter in the fight against social injustices (218). </sub>

> <sub> Consumers use luxury goods to signal their social status (222). </sub>

increase inequality through production but employ social media to address social injustices, bullshit?(219)

> Hypocrisy: A hypocrite is essentially characterized by behavior that contradicts what one claims to believe or feel (217).

## Follow, subscribe, comment, and like my content, right? 

> Pay for my Lamborghini because I want to take action against inequality.

> Support me to get advertisements, which promote a consumption culture, causing environmental damage and world inequality.

Is fighting inequality while benefiting from and generating inequality just nonsense?

> <sub> Write a book on inequality, publish it on Amazon, obtain 5-star reviews (each ~4€ on Telegram: "Amazon review DE, Amazon Produkttester, Amazon De tester 2"), and make it a bestseller through the Matthew Effect. The Matthew Effect describes a social pattern where initial advantages lead to further advantages, creating a growing disparity between resource-rich and resource-poor individuals (141). </sub>
  
## Is freedom for drug dealers acceptable?

> All societies prohibit drug dealers by law.

> <sub> Drug abuse: Addiction, Mental Health Disorder, Violence, Societal collapse, high Costs to Social Health, Economy & Family (8). Drug users cannot be treated as criminals (169); they suffer from something beyond their control (170). There is a £10,000-a-week trade of drug dealers (171). </sub> 

#### Is donating money to charities with funds obtained from drug selling morally justifiable?

> <sub> Pablo Escobar, a Colombian drug lord and leader of the Medellin Cartel, which controlled as much as 80% of international cocaine, helped the community by building schools and sports fields, donating vast sums to charity, and constructing housing (187) </sub>

#### The right drug and dosage can cure certain illnesses, addiction is people's own fault, acceptable?

>  they claim: not all drugs are harmful; for instance, opium has legitimate medical applications.[208](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1953-01-01_3_page008.html)

#### Can social media be considered harmful to societies, or are the effects primarily beneficial?

> <sub> 1. Mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and addiction. </sub>

> <sub> 2. Cyberbullying and online harassment. </sub>

> <sub> 3. Spread of false information and misinformation. </sub>

> <sub> 4. Encouragement of negative behaviors such as trolling, hate speech, and extremism. </sub>

> <sub> 5. Erosion of privacy and personal data security. </sub>

> <sub> 6. Disruption of social interactions and relationships. </sub>

> <sub> 7. Impact on productivity and time management. </sub>

> <sub> 8. Polarization and division of opinions and ideologies. </sub>

#### Social media is not entirely harmful, individuals are responsible for managing their own usage, right?

> Is it a valid argument for pornography creators to claim that individuals are responsible for their own porn addiction and that consumers must be aware of what they are consuming?

#### Is it socially and morally acceptable that a social media star earns 270 times more than a nursing assistant who makes ~ 1300€ per month? (1)(4)(5)

> <sub> 1. The content produced on platforms like OnlyFans is considered pornographic and is deemed harmful to society (28)(3). </sub>

> <sub> 2. Nurses play a crucial role in helping individuals, families, and groups reach their physical, psychological, and social potential, while the activity on OnlyFans has been linked to poor mental and emotional health in numerous studies and is considered detrimental to society (4)(7). </sub>

> <sub> 3. OnlyFans has been associated with pornography addiction and has been cited as a factor in a significant proportion of divorces. Top earners like Iggy Azalea can make hundreds of thousands of dollars in a matter of hours, creating a massive income gap between them and the average worker (2)(5)(6)(7)(29). </sub>

#### Is drug dealing an acceptable method for underprivileged social groups to achieve self-empowerment, emancipation, and financial independence?

> <sub> "The cultural scientist and feminist, Madita Oeming, sees OnlyFans as a new opportunity for self-empowerment. Women and men on OnlyFans are independent of studios or producers and have full control over their content and prices. There is also emancipatory potential in profit. 'Making that amount of money on your own can also save you from financial dependency and toxic relationships'" (9). </sub>

> <sub> Porn addiction, or problematic pornography use, affects approximately 3% to 6% of the adult population, with up to 65% of young adult men and 18% of young women reporting watching pornography at least once a week (35). Addicts are not solely to blame for their addiction; it is a problem for society as a whole, and we must address it as a shared responsibility (36). </sub>

## How do your Instagram likes lead to an atomic war? 

Why does consumption culture and social media lead to a nuclear disaster?
 
#### 1. Why do approximately 40% of the new generation choose to pursue a career as influencers?

> <sub> Despite the high earning potential of platforms like OnlyFans, being an influencer, YouTuber, or gamer, why should a young person consider working as a firefighter or nursing assistant for a relatively low salary of around €1300? </sub>

> <sub> While doctor, engineer, veterinarian and teacher were the most popular jobs for children in the past, today’s young generation aspires to be social influencers, with 86% of them choosing this career path(37)In the UK around 35% of children between 11-16 wants to be influencer and Youtuber (38) </sub>

> <sub> Germany lacks almost two million workers (39) </sub>

#### 2. How do millionaire social media influencers contribute to society?

> <sub> Cristiano Ronaldo (496m followers) Lionel Messi (373m followers) Kylie Jenner (372m followers) Selena Gomez (356m followers) Kim Kardashian (333m followers) Khloé Kardashian (279m followers) (40) or in Germany bibisbeautypalace, Julienco, Lisa und Lena mantler, Montana Black, Pia wurzbach, Pamela reif, dagibee,youneszarou </sub>

> <sub> 1. Instagram has faced accusations of sexualizing society. </sub>

> <sub> 2. Instagram is used by children. </sub> 

> <sub> 3. Early sexual activity can lead to unstable relationships and marriages when children grow up, which may contribute to lower birth rates and an aging population (10, 11, 12, 13, 14). </sub>

#### 3. Why does an aging population and labor shortage lead to exploitation? 

> <sub> An aging population can lead to economic collapse due to a lack of workers and skilled labor (15). Many migrants come from impoverished third-world countries (16), which can have consequences for their countries of origin such as economic disadvantages due to the loss of young workers, loss of highly qualified professionals (especially in healthcare), and social problems for children who have been left behind or have not grown up in large families (17). Remittances and money transfers may be blocked or subjected to UN sanctions (18), and poor countries often have negative trade balances with industrialized countries (19). A negative trade balance (more imports than exports) leads to unemployment and capital outflow (20). Exploitation is defined as inappropriate use, especially of manpower and resources, and in Marxist theories, it is more precisely defined as the appropriation of someone else's labor (21). </sub>

#### 4. Does exploitation contribute to international inequality? 

> <sub> Exploitation contributes to increased international inequality (22). Walter Scheidel, in his study tracing the global history of inequality from the Stone Age to today, shows that it never diminishes peacefully; violent shocks are needed to reduce inequality. For example, blanket bombing from the American air fleet and the use of atomic bombs led to a decline in social inequality (23).</sub>

#### 5. Can international inequality only be reduced through violent shocks?

> <sub> French colonization in Haiti ended only after the Haitian slaves rebelled, resulting in the Haitian Massacre, which claimed the lives of 75,000 white French and 350,000 Haitians (24). </sub>

> <sub> The end of slavery in the United States was due to slave uprisings and economic interests (25). </sub>

> <sub> World War II also led to a significant reduction in income and wealth inequality in many countries (26). </sub>

<sub> **End of Sanctions & Inequality after Atomic War?** </sub>

> <sub> North Korea possesses a 100 Kiloton atomic bomb (209), and Iran has enough enriched uranium to build several nuclear weapons, as stated by the UN (30). </sub>

## Does an atomic bomb bring freedom and equality?

> <sub> If everything becomes flat and equal, how can the world and the environment be exploited on a large scale? </sub>

#### May economic sanctions, brain drain, youth migration, and inequalities force a country to adopt a strategy of violent shock?

> According to poll results, around 80% of Iranians who desire an atomic bomb express support for defense based on the possession of such weapons (163).

> <sub> Over the years, Iranians have consistently expressed strong support for their country's nuclear program, according to polls. In 2006, 85% of Iranians supported it, and in 2010, the figure was 71%. Even in the face of sanctions, a Gallup poll in 2013 found that Iranians remained staunchly in favor of the program, with 84% expressing their desire for a nuclear weapon. A 2013 Zogby poll similarly found that a large majority of Iranians opposed ending uranium enrichment (84.5%) and ballistic missile testing (83.4%). These views were reaffirmed by a 2020 CISSM poll (155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161). </sub>

> <sub> In a 2013 Gallup Iran poll, respondents were asked about their views on sanctions against Iran. 46% of those surveyed held the U.S. responsible, while 13% held the Iranian government responsible, and 12% held the UN and EU responsible. 16% of respondents did not know who was responsible (165). </sub>

### Would a well-organized group in marginalized societies outside of a psychopathic regime use an atomic bomb, or current Leaders ? (216)

> Experts warn that new technologies like 3D printing make it easier to covertly produce weapons of mass destruction.

#### Why would leaders of psychopathic systems never utilize an atomic bomb?

> Contrary to common misconceptions, psychopaths are fully aware of the consequences of their actions; they are not insane (195).

> In 2013, Iran's religious leader Khamenei prohibited the development and deployment of nuclear weapons under Islamic law by issuing an irrevocable Fatwa. Following this, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who strongly supported Iran's nuclear program, has been disqualified from all Iranian elections since then (154, 162, 163, 164, 178).

#### Are violent tactics the only effective means to effectively tackle inequality?

> Global inequality has persisted since 1960 (138).

> Could the idea of granting voting power to all and removing psychopathic structures be an alternative solution?

## Can a nuclear war be avoided by "improving" democracy?

> <sub> Democracy has been considered the best political system since 508 BCE. However, despite its numerous advantages, democracy also has disadvantages: a polarizing debate culture, the development of psychopaths, corruption, misuse of equality, lack of protection for the common man, divide and rule methods, unfair business practices, addiction to power, and media misuse (63, 65). </sub>

> <sub> Social hierarchies exist in democracies, and research has shown that power can affect brain dynamics, with individuals of higher status exhibiting decreased accuracy in empathizing with individuals of lower status. Scientists have used a clever paradigm to study the correlation between brain regions associated with empathy and one's power status (220). </sub>

> <sub> Psychopathy is a serious personality disorder characterized by antisocial behavior, untruthfulness, irresponsibility, and lack of remorse or empathy (172). It is necessary to diagnose psychopathic personalities and prevent them from gaining power (79). Since psychopaths have no limitations on what they will do to reach the top, hierarchies tend to become top-heavy with psychopaths, turning democracy into a pathocracy (64, 68, 79, 80). </sub>

> <sub> Current political and economic systems provide an ideal environment for psychopaths to thrive. Approximately 1.2% of U.S. adult men and 0.3% to 0.7% of U.S. adult women are considered to have clinically significant levels of psychopathic traits (175). Furthermore, studies show that 15% of prisoners, 21% of CEOs, and many U.S. presidents exhibit psychopathic traits (44, 45, 46, 47). Aristotle warned us more than two millennia ago that democracies are the best environment for psychopaths to develop (49). In the past fifty years, psychopaths have gained almost absolute control of all branches of government (173) </sub>

> <sub> In Germany, it is estimated that approximately 84.3% of the population consists of ~505,000 males and 210,000 females with psychopathic profiles. Considering that 15% of prisoners and 21% of CEOs are psychopaths, it suggests a significant number of successful psychopaths in leadership positions in big companies and politics (177). </sub>

> <sub> Psychopaths can misuse democratic organizations. Corporations have legal departments to handle lawsuits, which can be financially and emotionally draining for individuals. Late bill payments can lead to negative financial consequences, such as late fees, credit score damage, and sometimes imprisonment. Additionally, the largest companies often avoid paying taxes (73, 74, 75, 76, 77). </sub>

> <sub> If someone is unable to pay their rent, how would the modern executive, legislative, and judiciary, which are responsible for creating billionaires and financed by taxpayers, address this situation? </sub>

> <sub> The New York Times claimed that Donald Trump was already a millionaire at the young age of 8. Throughout human history, this has never been a common occurrence because having substantial wealth has always come with its own set of issues and uncertainties. (210) </sub>

> <sub> Let's say someone inherits 3,000 apartments from their dad. Current Psychopathic System, help him to expand their apartment holdings to 6,000 units. Then, they pass it on to their child, who takes it further to 10,000 units. </sub> 

> <sub> Preventing psychopaths from obtaining power is challenging since there is no reliable test to identify a psychopath (82) </sub>
 
#### Should non-hierarchical systems be adopted due to the challenge of identifying psychopaths?

> <sub> As the saying goes, "He who sups with the devil should have a long spoon" (69, 70). <sub>

#### Could the solution to the 2,500-year-old problem of psychopathy in democracy be found in a simple voting app?

<sub> New smartphones offer advanced verification methods like fingerprint and face scans for tasks like online banking, enabling secure transactions of large sums of money. (72) </sub>

> Do smartphones have the potential to address significant issues or are they primarily designed for social media?
  
#### Can an app replace politicians, parliamentarians, presidents, governors, and other coveted positions that attract psychopaths?

> <sub> The President's responsibilities include treaty-making, bill vetoing and signing, representing the nation in foreign talks, enforcing laws, proposing new laws, leading a political party, hosting foreign guests, recognizing foreign countries, and granting pardons. Parliamentarians legislate and oversee the government's work. (66,67) </sub>

#### Is a gradual reduction and replacement of the existing psychopathic structure feasible?

> Eliminating hierarchies is crucial for reducing inequality.

> Current democracies can gradually incorporate an anti-psychopathy app without requiring a revolutionary change. A beta or pilot project can be tested in a village with 100 residents.

#### What are the advantages of personally holding money in your wallet instead of allowing psychopaths to control it?
  
> <sub> An interactive voting app can include a dedicated comments section that presents both the advantages and disadvantages, allowing users to vote for their preferred arguments. </sub>
-------------
*Examples*
> <sub> 1. Should monthly payment for ARD and ZDF be mandatory? </sub>
-------------
> <sub> 2. Should the police prioritize protecting vulnerable populations like women and the elderly over protecting capital, such as taking action against impoverished tenants, debtors of Amazon, supermarket looters, and climate activists? </sub>
-------------
> <sub> 3. Should we build a power plant in our village? </sub>

> <sub> After a 50%+ YES decision, which company should be chosen to build it? </sub>

> <sub> Should the money be paid gradually from each person's account or sent to a psychopathic system to pay the company? </sub>
-------------

> <sub> 4. Should sanctions be imposed on Russia, Saudi Arabia, the USA, or China for human rights violations? </sub>
-------------

> <sub> 5. Voting example in a village of 100 people: </sub> 

> <sub> User 76: The village is too dry. Do we need to plant trees? </sub> 

> <sub> No | Yes (How many trees should be planted? Click "Yes") </sub>

> <sub> On the right side, comments "for" it. </sub>
 
> <sub> User 4: Nature is essential for human mental health and well-being. According to a study, children also benefit from contact with nature. (20 votes) </sub>

> <sub> User 22: Trees are good for birds. (12 votes) </sub>

> <sub> On the left side, comments "against" it. </sub>

> <sub> User 74: Planting a new tree costs €30 and requires an investment in a water system and an external maintenance company. The cost is €100 per month, divided among 100 people. However, there are other ways to support the forest without additional costs. (20 votes) </sub>

> <sub> User 12: Planting trees is expensive, and we already have enough trees. (17 votes) </sub>

> <sub> Results: 80% of people want to plant trees. </sub>

> <sub> Which company is best suited to plant trees? Please add your comment. </sub>

> <sub> User 14: Company XXX charges only €20 per tree for planting and has low costs. </sub>

> <sub> User 20: Company YYY charges €30 per tree but is environmentally friendly as they don't use cars. </sub>

> <sub> Other Options: (cancel vote) due to no company found. (extend time) to find more companies. </sub>

> <sub> Result: Company XXX selected. </sub>

> <sub> Order created automatically and sent. </sub>

> <sub> Week 1: Company XXX has completed 25% of the work and is requesting 25% of the payment. Pictures and videos are available. </sub>

> <sub> Your part is €10. Accept? / Reject? </sub>

> <sub> After acceptance, €10 will be automatically sent to Company XXX. </sub>

> <sub> Week 2: Company XXX has completed 100%. Accept? / Reject?  </sub>
 
> <sub> After acceptance, €10 will be automatically sent to Company XXX. </sub>
-------------

> <sub> 6. Who should be taxed more? </sub>

> <sub> Fireman, nursing assistant, or teacher? </sub>

> <sub> YouTuber, Instagrammer, TikToker, or porn performer? </sub>


#### Is there a way to have a non-psychopathic economy without turning to communism?

> <sub> Can equal treatment of employees in a company affect quality, work ethic, effectiveness, and efficient use of resources? </sub>

> <sub> Although communism has never worked, the most social system in the world (Germany) has the highest industry quality and production. </sub>

> <sub> If millionaires were taxed appropriately for all the damages they caused (environmental, inequality, brain drain, forced migrations, travel, and consumerism supported by advertisement), would someone still be able to own empires like Microsoft, Tesla, and Amazon? </sub>

#### Why an Economic sector in the voting app is necessary?

> <sub> Instead of fixed salaries, incentivizing individuals with a percentage of the losses and victories boosts motivation. to illustrate, each person receives 2% (~2000€) per month, but can earn additional shares through requests or online votes for exceptional performance. </sub>

> <sub> since non-hierarchical companies are more sustainable for the world and environment, society may vote lower taxes for them.

 <sub> Embracing **Egoism**, self-interest, and increased earnings fosters greater competition, productivity, and sustainability. </sub>

## How does the lack of respect for human egoism contribute to communism and laziness?

 <sub> *Authentic egoists:* </sub>

> <sub> seek both the highest workplace equality and a commitment to fairness towards the world and the environment, enabling them to enjoy life to the fullest </sub>

> <sub> prioritize equality as the only means to ensure long-term safety and cleanliness within societies, while preventing revolutions and theft. </sub>

> <sub> oppose global inequality due to their aversion to the possibility of a nuclear attack </sub>

> <sub> uphold sustainable values, abstain from harmful substances and behaviors such as alcohol, cigarettes, promiscuity, pornography, and excessive social media usage, fostering a stable family unit. This, in turn, reduces dependence on imported labor, curbs the emergence of psychopathic multiculturalism and parallel societies, mitigates inequality, and prevents societal unrest. </sub>

## Multiculturalism: Does it lead to a tolerant and open-minded society or paralyzed parallel societies?

> Multiculturalism is often seen as a way to promote cultural exchange, tolerance, openness to other cultures, and new ideas. (110) However, there are also studies that show the opposite. Multiculturalism leads to social tensions, culture clash, polarization, marginalization, and language problems.

> A bounded confidence model is a model of consensus-like opinion dynamics in which agents interact only when their opinions are close enough.(111)

> Free circulation of information, social media, and debates can lead to group polarization.(112)(113) 

> People with similar points of view tend to follow, share, and comment on each other’s posts. Discussion of racial attitude items with others having similar attitudes significantly increased the gap between high- and low-prejudice groups. Based on that, extremists who meet and interact with each other in a place get even more extremist, which can raise the gap of parallel societies. (114,115,116)

#### Why Cultural dialogue ends in tribalism?

> The exchange of ideas and debates lead to more polarization.

> The decrease in the percentage of people who take friends or marry someone with different political viewpoints reflects how social media has made the atmosphere so polarizing.

> Devout religious belief or observance is not a predictor of extremism. However, studies show that support for terrorism in majority Muslim countries is related to how often you pray in a mosque, not how often you pray or how devout you are about food prohibitions. The same is also true of right-wing Jewish extremists in Israel.

> Nationalism and tolerance for autocratic leaders are rising all around the world most likely as a reaction to globalization.
 
> Research suggests that it’s bad for everyone’s well-being when the rich don’t have contact with the poor or the poor with the middle class. (211,212,213)

#### Can multiculturalism contribute to international inequality?

> <sub> Multiculturalism is essential for the survival of psychopathic economies and has huge economic benefits. </sub>

<sub> Germany is the biggest **Winner.** According to Brücker in 2013, without immigration, the labor force potential in Germany would fall by around 40% by 2050. (117) <sub>

#### Are the "Homeland countries" of migrants the biggest Winners, too?

> Immigration leads to a decrease in IQ in origin countries. Scotland has the lowest average IQ in the UK and performs poorly compared to most of Europe, according to studies.(119)

> Over 80% of intelligent students from top universities in third world countries migrate to industrial countries.(121)

> 77% of working people from a third world country are willing to migrate, according to a survey conducted by a Job Vision center.(120)

> Each young migrant in early working age costs their country of origin $120,000, according to international organizations.(118)

#### Is multiculturalism a result of a psychopathic economy?

Would individuals still seek refuge if economic disparities between third-world and industrial nations were eliminated?

> Psychopathic economies benefit from multiculturalism despite its increase in polarization and inequality.

## Integration of migrants has failed, bullshit? 

> Sweden: “Integration of migrants has failed” (166)

> **Integration:** the act of combining into an integral whole (167)

> **Combine:** implies some merging or mingling with corresponding loss of identity of each unit (168)

> Most top students from poor countries end up in industrial countries where their hi-tech products are most likely to be used by the US Army.(179)

> US Army operations are mostly conducted in the Middle East, including Libya, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia, Pakistan, and Sudan and also in South America.(180)

> Migrants come as worker to Psychopathical Systems, where their production are used to increase inequality against their homeland.

> psychopathological integration: psychopathegration

> Migrants often reject the traditions of psychopathic system residents, which contributed to the erosion of their populations, cultures, and values. However a migrant that choosed to leave their country, disregarding social and religious principles, in favor of endorsing to endorse a more Psychopathic System which perpetuates inequality, is fully psychopathegriert. (186)

#### why Economy prefer a psychopathegrated population to an organic population? 

> The lowered affinity of migrants towards their original values increases their susceptibility to psychopathological integration.

>  <sub> as sociopaths, Psychopathegrated population, have learned their behavior and are created by life experiences. They are capable of feeling emotions but usually don’t control them. Psychopaths, on the other hand, are born and suffer from a genetic effect (50,51) </sub>

The UK’s Indian, Pakistani, and Asian population surprised London by voting pro-Brexit.

> euroscepticism within the British South Asian population was stronger than previously anticipated.(197) 

> Iranian migrants organizing protests outside Iran to call for stricter sanctions against Iran. (221)

## Calling residents of Germany, Netherlands, etc **"a Society"**, bullshit?

> <sub> SOCIETY: people in general thought of as living together in organized communities with **shared** laws, traditions, and **values** (83) Cooperation is vital for human survival as it enables us to thrive in large groups. By living collectively, we can effectively collaborate and distribute tasks based on individual strengths, resulting in improved efficiency and productivity. </sub>

> *Modern Society:*

> <sub> consider “LGBTQIA2S+” a non-negotiable value, but Accept to throw away  the “one love” band for participating in a Football match. (106) </sub>

> <sub> claim to Respect World Peace, while Start war for bring democracy in other countries.  

## Sacrify Yourself for Psychopath Leaders, bullshit?

#### In modern societies, are people likely to resist and fight in the event of a War attack?

> <sub> 1. Approximately 30,000 fighters from at least 85 countries joined the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which had very clear defined religious values. Around 6.6 million Syrians and 1.5 million Iraqis, as well as many from Lebanon, Jordan, etc., fled the area, with approximately 90% being young Muslim men. According to the Qur’an and hadith, fleeing from Jihad (war) is a greater sin and is considered the twenty-seventh sin. Additionally, the prophet of Islam said: “I disown every Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen” (Christians, Jews). (85,86,87,88,89,90,91) </sub>

#### Can mass of people, without any shared values be considered **a Society**?
