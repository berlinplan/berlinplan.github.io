<sub> Kindly consider the following questions, with the grey texts as additional information. </sub>

### Smarter smartphones, the cure for cancer, and the elimination of hunger in Africa, if slavery still persisted?

> #### Benefits of Slavery for World Development: (224)

- <sub> **1. The improvement of African lives:** The slave trade fostered international commerce between Africa, the USA, and Europe. Numerous goods were exchanged with Africa in return for slaves. These products were subsequently utilized within Africa to enhance the well-being of its people. Additionally, the slave market attracted increased European visitors who engaged in goods exchange with Americans and Africans. </sub>
- <sub> **2. Multiculturalism:** When different countries interacted, they exchanged their culture. This helped in building long-term relationships and developing nations. Besides, the slave trade also led to intermarriage. People from different continents intermarried to produce mixed races. </sub>
- <sub> **3. Free trade:** Slavery contributed to free trade by providing European farms with cost-free labor, boosting profitability and economic growth. </sub> 
- <sub> **4. Quick production:** Slavery enabled rapid production in industries, with efficient contributions from slaves in the manufacturing process. </sub>
- <sub> **5. Economic stability:** Slavery served as a stabilizing force for Britain's economy during the colonial era, as it harnessed the economic benefits of enslaved labor. </sub>
- <sub> **6. Transport system:** The slave trade drove the rapid development of the transport industry across the Atlantic, leading to innovations in shipbuilding. </sub>
- <sub> **7. Job security:** The master had to feed the slaves even when they got sick or became too old. This was the main reason why some people would join slavery voluntarily. Also, when there was no work available, the master had to feed his slaves for future jobs. </sub>
- <sub> **8. Exploration:** Slave trade was one of the factors that contributed to exploration in Africa, Europe, and America. Traders would explore new places each time they visited a different market. </sub>
- <sub> **9. Development:** Slave owners saved money by not hiring employees, resulting in higher profits and potential local development. </sub>
- <sub> *Slavery played a significant role in the growth of the United States. (214).* </sub>
- <sub> *Colonization had a profound impact on development in Western countries (215).* </sub>

##  Can street blockades and polarization effectively solve the environmental crisis?

> - Blocking streets to be seen on Instagram and Youtube, or to gain political power for one's own group, is an effective approach? Or would such measures polarize society in such a way that even possible effective solutions would no longer be heard? (223)

## How environmentally friendly are e-cars?

> E-cars require ten times more chips than petrol or diesel vehicles. The Chips Act, passed by Joe Biden, restricts US technology involvement in semiconductor production. As technology manufacturers prioritize profit, poorer countries rely on importing technology, perpetuating a cycle of wealth inequality that benefits the rich and leaves the poor behind. This contributes to the growing inequality (139, 140).


##  #awareness #equality #woke #muslimlivesmatter, credible?

> <sub> Luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Gucci support social justice movements on social media (#equality, #blacklivesmatter), but also sell luxury goods for status signaling. (218, 219, 222). </sub>

> Hypocrisy: A hypocrite is essentially characterized by behavior that contradicts what one claims to believe or feel (217).

## Follow, subscribe, comment, and like my content, to what? 

> Support my Tesla purchase and join me in the fight against inequality.

How does supporting a social media activist in getting ads that promote consumption, leading to environmental damage and global inequality, contribute to fighting injustices?

## Can we justify freedom for drug dealers?

> Laws exist in most societies to forbid drug dealers.

> <sub> Drug abuse: Addiction, Mental Health Disorder, Violence, Societal collapse, high Costs to Social Health, Economy & Family (8). Drug users cannot be treated as criminals (169); they suffer from something beyond their control (170). There is a £10,000-a-week trade of drug dealers (171). </sub> 

#### Is it morally justifiable to donate drug money to charities?

> <sub> Pablo Escobar, a Colombian drug lord and leader of the Medellin Cartel, which controlled as much as 80% of international cocaine, helped the community by building schools and sports fields, donating vast sums to charity, and constructing housing (187) </sub>

#### Right drug and dosage can cure certain illnesses, addiction is people's own fault, acceptable?

>  they claim: not all drugs are harmful; for instance, opium has legitimate medical applications. [208](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1953-01-01_3_page008.html)

#### Social media is not entirely harmful, individuals are responsible for managing their own usage, accetpable?

> - <sub> Is it a valid argument for influencers or pornography creators to claim that individuals are responsible for their own addiction and should be aware of the content they consume, considering the documented effects of social media like mental health issues, cyberbullying, false information, negative behaviors, privacy concerns, disrupted social interactions, reduced productivity, polarization, influence on self-image, and exposure to inappropriate content?[207](https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/social-media-and-mental-health.htm#:~:text=Since%20it's%20a%20relatively%20new,harm%2C%20and%20even%20suicidal%20thoughts.) </sub>

#### Is it fair for a social media star to earn 270 times more than a nursing assistant making ~ €1300 per month? (1)(4)(5)

> <sub> Despite the documented negative effects of activities on platforms like OnlyFans, including societal harm, poor mental health, and contributing to divorce rates, top earners on these platforms can make huge sums of money in a short time. This creates a significant income gap compared to average workers, including caregivers who support individuals, families, and groups in achieving their physical, psychological, and social potential (4)(28)(3)(2)(5)(6)(7)(29). </sub>

#### Does drug dealing offer self-empowerment, emancipation, and financial independence to underprivileged social groups?

> <sub> "The cultural scientist and feminist, Madita Oeming, sees OnlyFans as a new opportunity for self-empowerment. Women and men on OnlyFans are independent of studios or producers and have full control over their content and prices. There is also emancipatory potential in profit. 'Making that amount of money on your own can also save you from financial dependency and toxic relationships'" (9). </sub>

> <sub> Porn addiction affects a notable percentage of adults, particularly young men and women who regularly consume pornography (35). Taking collective responsibility is crucial in addressing this societal issue. (35, 36). </sub>


 ### Why Döner Kebab Sellers are Terrorists? 

Kebab terror: If a person's family in xxxistan tragically loses their lives due to mistaken actions by a military force, who can be held accountable? Should it be the bomb, the pilot, the airplane, the semiconductor manufacturer, the tool manufacturer for that semiconductor, or even the doner kebab seller who supplied food to the tool company workers?

#### Is it possible to act morally without having defined Values?

> morality: standards of behaviour; principles of right and wrong. (190)

> Absence of clear values hinders moral acts, enabling corruption and eroding societal morality in psychopathic democracies.(122)
 
  
#### Are current rules Sufficient to decide the morality of an Act?

> While some people rely on religious leaders for moral guidance, others follow Kant's Golden Rule or consequentialist principles, which judge an act's ethics based on favorable outcomes. However, religious and political psychopaths often justify their actions by claiming positive outcomes, exposing the lack of a universal moral definition.

## Why do ideological groups like IRGC Quds, ISIS, and Al-Qaida surpass modern armies?

> Strong values and flexible structures in ideological groups compared to hierarchical pathocratic armies with conflicting morals.

## residents of modern Societies like Germany are "society"?
  
  > <sub> **Society** refers to people living together in organized communities with shared laws, traditions, and **values**. Cooperation is vital for human survival as it allows us to thrive in large groups, collaborate effectively, and distribute tasks based on individual strengths, leading to improved efficiency and productivity.(83) </sub>
  
  > *Modern Society Values:*

- <sub> considers LGBTQIA2S+ rights non-negotiable while allowing the abandonment of the "one love" band during a football match. (106) </sub>
- <sub> impose heavy sanctions against human rights violators while maintaining strong ties with the world's biggest violators of human rights. (107,108,153) </sub>
- <sub> While claiming to respect world peace, sometimes engage in wars to bring democracy to other nations. </sub>


## would people resist, fight and Sacrifize for a psychopathic system by a war attack?

> <sub> 1. Around 30,000 fighters from 85 countries joined ISIS, an organization with strong religious values. Approximately 10 million Syrians, Iraqis, and individuals from neighboring countries, primarily young Muslim men, fled the area. Islamic teachings consider fleeing from jihad (war) as a significant sin, ranked as the twenty-seventh sin. The prophet of Islam also expressed disapproval of Muslims settling among Christians and Jews. (85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91) </sub>

#### Can a mass of people without any shared values be considered a **society**?

> <sub> 2. Over a million young Afghans have fled Afghanistan after the fall of the Afghan republic. Despite spending $145 billion on security forces and civilian government institutions over 20 years, the US and the West were unable to prevent the fall of the Afghan republic as soon as US troops left. President Ashraf Ghani, who had pledged to stay and protect his people, fled the capital city by helicopter to Uzbekistan, contradicting his previous promises. (93, 95) </sub>

**Can it be said that the Taliban society targets a group of people with no shared values?**

> <sub> 3. Ukraine has been ranked among the most corrupt nations, with The Guardian dubbing it "the most corrupt nation in Europe" (97). Ukraine's corruption level is comparable to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, like Uganda (99). Besides monopoly and lack of transparency, a significant factor contributing to corruption in Ukraine is the moral collapse (104). Despite these challenges, the beauty industry in Ukraine is thriving, with Ukrainians dedicating a considerable portion of their income to cosmetic products (100). The major industries in Ukraine include banking, cafés, grocery stores, beauty, and clothing stores (101). The Russian Army comprises contracted personnel and volunteers, while Ukrainian male citizens aged 18-60 face restrictions on leaving the country (102). Nevertheless, there are over 8 million Ukrainian refugees in Europe, constituting approximately 20% of the population (103).(105). </sub> 

**Despite martial law, 8.2 million fled Ukraine. What would the numbers be without it?**


 #### How voting apps creates first Societes?

 Individuals who share similar values, such as Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, Muslims, atheists, and those who adhere to Western values, can come together and form a group. </sub>
  
## What is a "Oversociety"?
  
> Contains All Societies
  
> If society 1, 2, 3, Christian, Hindu, Chinese, Islamic, and Atheist societies all share the common value of prohibiting nuclear weapons, then all societies must comply.

> If society 3 possesses and maintains atomic bombs, the Oversociety must decide how to respond, whether through punishment, isolation, or even attack. No priority is given to American, Western, Muslim, or African values when making decisions about the Oversociety.

#### Can international inequality be solved within the Oversociety? 

> In the absence of corrupt politicians, every individual holds power and can take action against a society that causes harm to others.

- <sub> For example, if Society 6 adopts a psychopathic economy leading to inequality, an aging population, migration, a loss of workforce, family issues, increased intercontinental flights, and growing polarization, the Oversociety must decide how to address this behavior, as it harms everyone involved.  </sub>
- <sub> Society 1: 60% adheres to Islamic values, which include wearing hijab, abstaining from alcohol, avoiding premarital sex, and not engaging in open relationships. </sub>
- <sub> Society 2: 70% adheres to xxx values, where drinking alcohol and engaging in premarital sex are permissible, but open relationships are not allowed. </sub>
- <sub> Society 11: 75% adheres to Western values, including freedom of clothing, food choices, and actions. </sub>
 
Societies merge when they share the same values.
> <sub> By uniting Buddhist societies in Asia and South America under a shared set of values, it becomes possible to establish a unified nation. </sub>
  
**Could this lead to a meaningful cultural inspiration?**

> Would other societies adopt the positive values of a high-performing for example Buddhist society?

> Could Muslims be inspired by Christians who have healthier babies due to avoiding cousin marriages?

> Can Christians be inspired by Muslims to reduce alcohol consumption and have more stable relationships?

#### How did cultural inspiration occur in the past?

> <sub> Cultural influences between Asia and the West have been diverse, including the introduction of mathematical zero and the binary code (226). </sub>

> <sub> Western influences on Eastern culture have been significant, particularly in the modern era, impacting aspects such as food, fashion, lifestyle, and governance (227). </sub>

> <sub> During Atatürk's rule, Westernizing reforms were implemented across political, legal, religious, cultural, social, and economic policies (182). </sub>

> <sub> In 1698, Tsar Peter I of Russia introduced a beard tax as part of an effort to align Russian society with Western European models (181). </sub>

> <sub> One of the Westernizing actions taken by Iranian Reza Shah was the enforcement of Western suits and hats for men (183).  </sub>

> <sub> Japan underwent early Westernization and modernization (184).) </sub>

#### How do cultures influence and inspire one another? 

> <sub> Comparisons are a natural part of human cognition and can contribute to the process of self-improvement (185). <sub>


## Multiculturalism: Does it lead to a tolerant and open-minded society or foster parallel societies?

> Multiculturalism is often viewed as a means to promote cultural exchange, tolerance, openness, and new ideas. However, studies indicate that it can also lead to social tensions, culture clashes, polarization, marginalization, and language problems.(110)

> A bounded confidence model describes consensus-like opinion dynamics, where agents interact only when their opinions are sufficiently similar. (111)

> Free circulation of information, social media, and debates can contribute to group polarization. (112)(113) 

> People with similar viewpoints tend to follow, share, and comment on each other's posts. Discussions on racial attitudes with individuals who hold similar attitudes can significantly increase the gap between high- and low-prejudice groups. This interaction among extremists can further exacerbate the gap and contribute to the formation of parallel societies. (114,115,116)

#### Why does cultural dialogue often result in tribalism?

> The exchange of ideas and debates can lead to increased polarization.

> The decrease in the percentage of people who befriend or marry individuals with different political viewpoints reflects how social media has contributed to polarization.

> Devout religious belief or observance does not necessarily predict extremism. However, studies indicate that support for terrorism in majority Muslim countries is related to mosque attendance rather than individual prayer frequency or adherence to food prohibitions. Similar patterns can be observed among right-wing Jewish extremists in Israel.

> Nationalism and tolerance for autocratic leaders are rising globally, possibly as reactions to globalization. Research suggests that the well-being of everyone is negatively impacted when the rich do not interact with the poor or when the poor have limited contact with the middle class. (211,212,213)

#### Can multiculturalism contribute to international inequality?

> <sub> Multiculturalism is essential for the survival of psychopathic economies and has huge economic benefits. </sub>

<sub> Germany is the biggest **Winner.** According to Brücker in 2013, without immigration, the labor force potential in Germany would fall by around 40% by 2050. (117) <sub>

#### Do the countries of origin of migrants also benefit?

> Immigration can lead to a decrease in average IQ in the countries of origin. Studies have shown that Scotland, for instance, has the lowest average IQ in the UK and performs less favorably compared to most European countries.(119)

> Over 80% of intelligent students from third-world countries migrate to industrialized nations, as highlighted by research.(121)

> A survey conducted by a Job Vision center found that 77% of working individuals from third-world countries are willing to migrate.(120)

> International organizations estimate that each young migrant in their early working age costs their country of origin $120,000.(118)

#### Is multiculturalism a consequence of a psychopathic economy?
  
Would individuals still seek refuge if economic disparities between third-world and industrial nations were eliminated?

> Despite its potential for polarization and inequality, psychopathic economies often benefit from multiculturalism.

## Has the integration of migrants failed?

> Sweden: “Integration of migrants has failed” (166)

> **Integration:** the act of combining into an integral whole (167)

> **Combine:** implies some merging or mingling with corresponding loss of identity of each unit (168)

> People from poor countries migrate to industrialized nations, where their high-tech products are more likely to be utilized, especially by the US Army, which often operates in migrants countries of origin. Despite migrants resisting the acceptance of values from psychopathic systems that have led to the erosion of their own populations, cultures, and values, they are already fully integrated into the heavy psychopathic system as they live and work in a system that perpetuates inequality (psychopathegration). (179,180,186)

#### Why does the economy favor psychopathically integrated populations over organic ones?

> The reduced affinity of migrants towards their original values increases their susceptibility to psychopathic integration.

>  <sub> as sociopaths, Psychopathegrated population, have learned their behavior and are created by life experiences. They are capable of feeling emotions but usually don’t control them. Psychopaths, on the other hand, are born and suffer from a genetic effect (50,51) </sub>

The Indian, Pakistani, and Asian population in the UK surprised London by voting in favor of Brexit, indicating stronger euroscepticism within this community than previously anticipated. (197) 

> Iranian migrants have organized protests outside Iran, calling for stricter sanctions against their home country. (221)
 
  
 ## Why does democracy end in an atomic bomb?

- <sub> While democracy is considered the best political system, it has drawbacks: polarizing debates, corruption, lack of protection for the common man, divide-and-rule tactics, unfair business practices, power addiction, media misuse, and rising inequality. Power dynamics in social hierarchies affect empathy, with higher-status individuals showing decreased accuracy in empathizing with lower-status individuals. (138).(63, 220, 65). </sub>
- <sub> Psychopathy is a severe personality disorder characterized by antisocial behavior, deceitfulness, irresponsibility, and a lack of empathy. Preventing psychopaths from gaining power is crucial to avoid turning democracy into a pathocracy, as they have no limits in reaching the top. (64, 68, 79, 80, 172). </sub>
- <sub> Political and economic systems provide an ideal environment for psychopaths to thrive. Approximately 1% of the whole population, including 15% of prisoners, 21% of CEOs, and many US presidents, exhibit psychopathic traits. Aristotle warned about the susceptibility of democracies to foster psychopaths over two millennia ago. In the past fifty years, psychopaths have gained significant control over all branches of government. (44, 45, 46, 47,49,173,175) </sub>
- <sub> Many successful psychopaths hold leadership positions in big companies and politics, allowing them to exploit democratic organizations. Late bill payments can result in severe financial consequences for individuals, including late fees, credit score damage, and even imprisonment. On the contrary, corporations that often find ways to avoid paying taxes have legal departments to handle lawsuits. (73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 177). </sub>
- <sub> If someone is unable to pay their rent, how would the modern executive, legislative, and judiciary, which are responsible for creating billionaires and financed by taxpayers, address this situation? </sub>
- <sub> The New York Times claimed that Donald Trump was already a millionaire at the young age of 8. Throughout human history, this has never been a common occurrence because having substantial wealth has always come with its own set of issues and uncertainties. (210) </sub>
- <sub> Let's say someone inherits 3,000 apartments from their dad. Current Psychopathic System, help him to expand their apartment holdings to 6,000 units. Then, they pass it on to their child, who takes it further to 10,000 units. </sub> 
- <sub> Preventing psychopaths from obtaining power is challenging since there is no reliable test to identify a psychopath (82) </sub>

## How do your Instagram likes lead to an atomic war? 

Why does psychopathical systems, consumption culture and social media lead to a nuclear disaster?
 
#### 1. Why do 40% of the new generation prefer to be influencers over other professions?

> <sub> Why should young individuals choose lower-paying jobs like firefighters and nursing assistants over the high-earning potential of being influencers, YouTubers, or gamers? Today's young generation overwhelmingly aspires to be social influencers, with 86% in the USA and 40% in the UK choosing this career path. Is this contributing to the shortage of nearly two million workers in Germany? (37,38,39) </sub>

#### 2. How do millionaire social media influencers benefit society?

> <sub> Cristiano Ronaldo (496m followers) Lionel Messi (373m followers) Kylie Jenner (372m followers) Selena Gomez (356m followers) Kim Kardashian (333m followers) Khloé Kardashian (279m followers) (40) or in Germany bibisbeautypalace, Julienco, Lisa und Lena mantler, Montana Black, Pia wurzbach, Pamela reif, dagibee,youneszarou </sub>

- <sub> 1. Instagram has faced accusations of sexualizing society. </sub>
- <sub> 2. Instagram is used by children. </sub> 
- <sub> 3. Early sexual activity can lead to unstable relationships and marriages when children grow up, which may contribute to lower birth rates and an aging population (10, 11, 12, 13, 14). </sub>

#### 3. How does an aging population and labor shortage contribute to international inequality & exploitation?

> <sub> An aging population's lack of workers and skilled labor in Industrial Countries can lead to economic collapse in third-world countries, from where migrants originate. This situation results in economic disadvantages, the loss of qualified professionals (especially in healthcare), and social problems for children who are left behind or do not grow up in large families. Remittances and money transfers may be blocked or face UN sanctions, while poor countries often experience negative trade balances with industrialized nations. Negative trade balances contribute to unemployment and capital outflow. Exploitation, as defined by Marxist theories, involves the inappropriate use of manpower and resources, specifically the appropriation of someone else's labor and contributes to increased international inequality (15,16,17,18,19,20,21, 22)  </sub>

#### 4. Can violent shocks be the only solution to reducing international inequality?
  
> <sub>  Studies on the global history of inequality suggests that peaceful means have never effectively diminished it. Examples include the use of violent tactics such as blanket bombing, atomic bombs, slave uprisings, and wars, which have led to declines in social inequality. French colonization in Haiti ended after the Haitian slaves rebelled, resulting in the Haitian Massacre. Similarly, the end of slavery in the United States was driven by slave uprisings and economic factors. World War II also contributed to a notable reduction in income and wealth inequality across many nations. (23,24,25 26). </sub>


#### May economic sanctions, brain drain, youth migration, and inequalities drive a country to resort to violent measures?

> <sub> If everything becomes flat, how can the world and the environment be exploited on a large scale? Could Iran enriched uranium to build several nuclear weapons or North Korea's 100-kiloton atomic bomb potentially end sanctions and lead to equality?(30,209 )</sub>

## How to grant people the freedom and equality to utilize an atom bomb?

> <sub> Over the years, Iranians have consistently shown strong backing for their country's nuclear program. In 2006, support reached 85%, and in 2010, it was 71%. Even amid sanctions, a 2013 Gallup poll found that 84% of Iranians expressed a desire for nuclear weapons. A 2013 Zogby poll similarly indicated majority opposition (84.5%) to ending uranium enrichment and ballistic missile testing (83.4%). Responsibility for sanctions varied among respondents, with 46% holding the U.S. responsible, 13% attributing it to the Iranian government, and 12% to the UN and EU, while 16% were uncertain. (155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161,163, 165). </sub>

#### Why would leaders in psychopathic regimes never utilize an atomic bomb, but marginalized groups outside of psychopathic power might?

> Experts warn that advancements like 3D printing make it easier for non-hierarchical groups to secretly produce weapons of mass destruction. Meanwhile, current people in power would less likely use it. Contrary to misconceptions, psychopaths are fully aware of the consequences of their actions; they are not insane. In 2013, Iran's religious Supreme leader issued an irrevocable Fatwa prohibiting the development and deployment of nuclear weapons under Islamic law. Since then, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a strong supporter of Iran's nuclear program, has been disqualified from all Iranian elections. (154, 162, 163, 164, 178, 195,216).

 
#### Should non-hierarchical systems be adopted due to the challenge of identifying psychopaths?

> <sub> As the saying goes, "He who sups with the devil should have a long spoon" (69, 70). <sub>

#### Could the solution to the 2,500-year-old problem of psychopathy in democracy be found in a simple voting app?
  
<sub> New smartphones offer advanced verification methods like fingerprint and face scans for tasks like online banking, enabling secure transactions of large sums of money. (72) </sub>

> Do smartphones have the potential to address significant issues or are they primarily designed for social media?
  
#### Can an app replace politicians, parliamentarians, presidents, governors, and other coveted positions that attract psychopaths?

> <sub> The President's responsibilities include treaty-making, bill vetoing and signing, representing the nation in foreign talks, enforcing laws, proposing new laws, leading a political party, hosting foreign guests, recognizing foreign countries, and granting pardons. Parliamentarians legislate and oversee the government's work. (66,67) </sub>

#### Is a gradual reduction and replacement of the existing psychopathic structure feasible?

> Eliminating hierarchies is crucial for reducing inequality.

> Current democracies can gradually incorporate an anti-psychopathy app without requiring a revolutionary change. A beta or pilot project can be tested in a village with 100 residents.

#### Why is it better to hold your own money instead of letting psychopaths control it?
  
> <sub> An interactive voting app can include a dedicated comments section that presents both the advantages and disadvantages, allowing users to vote for their preferred arguments. </sub>
 
*Examples*
- <sub> 1. Should monthly payment for ARD and ZDF be mandatory? </sub>
  
- <sub> 2. Should the police prioritize protecting vulnerable populations like women and the elderly over protecting capital, such as taking action against impoverished tenants, debtors of Amazon, supermarket looters, and climate activists? </sub>
  
- <sub> 3. Should we build a power plant in our village? </sub>
  - <sub> After a 50%+ YES decision, which company should be chosen to build it? </sub>
    - <sub> Should the money be paid gradually from each person's account or sent to a psychopathic system to pay the company? </sub>
  
- <sub> 4. Should sanctions be imposed on Russia, Saudi Arabia, the USA, or China for human rights violations? </sub>

Example 6:
The system is not complete and needs development. it could still be worth it if you consider that in the current system, large projects such as airports, but also simple projects, are corrupted by millions of euros.
Even in the democracies with little corruption, Germany, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden.

- <sub> 5. Who should be taxed more? </sub>
- <sub> Fireman, nursing assistant, or teacher? </sub>
- <sub> YouTuber, Instagrammer, TikToker, or porn performer? </sub>

#### Is there a way to have a non-psychopathic economy without turning to communism?

> <sub> Can equal treatment of employees in a company affect quality, work ethic, effectiveness, and efficient use of resources? </sub>

> <sub> Although communism has never worked, the most social system in the world (Germany) has the highest industry quality and production. </sub>

> <sub> If millionaires were taxed appropriately for all the damages they caused (environmental, inequality, brain drain, forced migrations, travel, and consumerism supported by advertisement), would someone still be able to own empires like Microsoft, Tesla, and Amazon? </sub>

#### Why is the inclusion of an Economic sector necessary in the voting app?

> <sub> Incentivizing individuals with a percentage of losses and victories, instead of fixed salaries, enhances motivation. For instance, each person receives a base amount of 2% (~2000€) per month but can earn additional shares through exceptional performance, requests, or online votes. </sub>

> <sub> Non-hierarchical companies, which are more sustainable for the world and environment, may be favored by society through lower taxes determined by voting. </sub>

 <sub> Embracing egoism, self-interest, and increased earnings fosters greater competition, productivity, and sustainability. </sub>

## How does egoismus lead to equality??

 <sub> *Egoists who seeks maximal joy in life:* </sub>

 - <sub> Strive for workplace equality and fairness towards the world and the environment, enabling them to lead fulfilling lives. </sub>
- <sub> Prioritize equality as a means to ensure long-term safety and cleanliness in societies, thereby preventing revolutions and theft. </sub>
- <sub> Oppose global inequality due to the potential risk of a nuclear attack. </sub>
- <sub> Uphold sustainable values, abstaining from harmful substances and behaviors, and promoting stable family units. This reduces dependence on imported labor, mitigates inequality, prevents societal unrest, and curbs the emergence of psychopathic multiculturalism and parallel societies. </sub>

    
## How to stop the Islamization of Europe?

> Mohammed ranked as the most popular name for baby boys in Berlin in 2022 (225). Sweden could have a Muslim population of 31% by 2050, while Germany's could be 20%, and in big cities such as Berlin, Düsseldorf, or Köln, this number could rise to 60%. It's possible that the concept of Islamic Sharia could gain traction in Berlin as a reflection of the growing Muslim population. This growth in Islam is not limited to Europe, as it is currently the fastest-growing religion in India, the USA, China, and Sub-Saharan countries (127, 128, 129, 130).

#### How have big states attempted to curb the growth of Islam?

- China: Hormone therapy of Muslims (Chinese Uyghur genocide) (131)
- India: Anti-Muslim Laws. New Citizenship Law, Disturbed Area Act. Ghettoize Muslims. (132) (133)
- USA: Muslim ban! (134)
- The European Court has allowed bans on religious dress in countries like Austria, Belgium, and France, where the hijab and niqab have been prohibited (135)

#### Why is Islam the world's fastest-growing religion?
 
> The growing number of Muslims is mainly due to higher birth rates in Muslim families, not new converts to Islam (136)

#### What role do stable marriages and families play in countering the expansion of Islam?

> Society's values and civilization depend on families' foundational role (124) (123)

#### Do stable family values align with religious values? (137)

> Could accepting Islamic/religious values be an effective way to counter the expansion of Islam as it gains influence around the world?

**Values are defined by individuals in the Voting app, similar to religion but without institution and corruption.**

#### Does "religion" provide the most sustainable freedom? 

> Studies reveal that respecting and defining certain factors result in stable relationships, which leads to sustainability and equality.

> Monogamy is the most consistent and stable form of relationship for individuals and families, similar to religious values.

<sub> **Considering aging populations and issues with societal values, is the promotion of stable families the most effective way to promote global equality and consistency?** </sub>

## Sexual freedom and open relationships: bullshit?

If a freedom harms others, is it sustainable?

> A society that adopts open relationships and sexual freedom, resulting in an aging population and increased immigration and inequality, is that freedom sustainable?

#### Which criteria are crucial for establishing a stable family?

Red flags for stable relationships:
<sub> *if someone* </sub>
- <sub> Has a history of multiple partners prior to marriage or was sexually active in their teenage years. </sub>
- <sub> Consumes alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. </sub>
- <sub> Engages in pornography, social media, and gaming addictions. </sub>
- <sub> Has many friends or family members who are divorced or not in stable relationships. </sub>
- <sub> Is employed in occupations involving the body, entertainment, and physical appearance. </sub>
- <sub> Seeking partner in bars and clubs and dating apps. (~40%)(126) </sub>
- <sub> Approaches strangers on the street without hesitation and inhibitions with sexual intentions. </sub>

#### Do women favor polygynous societies?

> The argument for women's choice in polygyny posits that they would have the autonomy to select their partners in polygynous societies. Additionally, it assumes that women's rights, stature, and freedoms in traditions of monogamy aren't constrained by the institution itself. (147)

#### Do dating apps empower or disempower women?

> Online dating apps claim to empower women and promote Sexual equality. (150)

#### How do psychopathic dating platforms contribute to international inequality?

Online dating has been linked to an increase in sexual activity. Multiple sexual activity leads to higher turnover rates among sexual partners, which can decrease birthrates and cause ageing population.(13,14,61,62)

Psychopaths tend to **thrive** in online dating environments due to their engagement in promiscuous sexual behavior and short-term marital relationships.(59)

#### How do dating apps contribute to open relationships and polygyny?

Dating apps are increasingly popular, attracting millions of users. They enable the top 5% of men to connect with 95% of women, leading to more sexual activity and an increase in open relationships. This, in turn, often results in polygyny, where men exhibit renewed sexual interest when encountering new females. Unlike females, men are influenced by the Coolidge effect, seeking variety in short-term partners. Research studies and experiments, including a Tinder-style study, have consistently shown that men exhibit a higher preference for multiple sexual partners compared to women. (55,56,62,146,149,151,152)

#### How does polygyny affect men, women, and children in society?

> <sub> Polygynous societies result in lower status and freedom for women, increased violence, and abuse, and poorer mental and physical health. Children in polygynous families also experience more problems and have higher mortality rates. Polygyny creates an imbalance in the number of unmarried men and women, leading to intense competition among men for mates and motivating male control over their female family members. Unmarried men are more likely to commit crimes than married men, and polygynous husbands have more extramarital affairs than monogamous husbands. Additionally, competition for wives increases in societies where women and children are important laborers, leading to a larger number of unmarried males.</sub>

#### Do competitions on psychopathic platforms create value and foster improvement?

The popularity of various platforms promoting psychopathic behaviors such as beauty operations, dating apps, pickup and alpha masculinity coaches, hook up and ghost culture, style coaches, and online dating profile designers is increasing. (58, 57, 60)



#### How can individuals spend their free time without psychopathic entertainment?

- <sub> Engage in quality time with family, enjoying outdoor activities, pursuing creative hobbies, playing games, reading, and volunteering. Avoid the sexualized content on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. </sub>
- <sub> Contribute to environmental sustainability by addressing past damages and supporting local food production instead of relying on distant imports like avocados. </sub>

### What defined the pre-religious barbaric era?

> During this era, common behaviors included living in clans, following minor prophets and gods, exhibiting pride and boasting, practicing polygyny, engaging in gambling and alcohol consumption, embracing superstitions, participating in various sexual activities, seeking personal gain, and practicing usury. Bloody fights were frequent, and physical attributes such as muscles, height, and testosterone levels for men, as well as physical features like breast and hip size for women, played significant roles in attraction. (188) 

## Modern psychopathic barbarism: Barbaropathism?

- <sub> Berlin hosts diverse clans: Lebanese Shiites, Lebanese Sunnis, Turks, Afghans, hipsters, conservatives, and Moroccans. </sub>
- <sub> Attraction factors: Muscles, bodybuilding, testosterone injections for men; cosmetic procedures, large breasts, social media presence for women. </sub>
- <sub> Online Clans: Facebook groups, fan communities, YouTube algorithms leading to continuous recommendations on similar topics. </sub>

- <sub> Superstitions: Energy spirituality on social media. </sub>
- <sub> Sexual activities: Bumble, Hinge, Tinder leading to open relationships and hypergyny. </sub>
- <sub> Profiteering and usury: Crypto trading, forex, passive income, property investments. (189) </sub>

#### Would psychopathic solutions address the inequality caused by the psychopathic system?

Boris Palmer's proposal suggests that asylum seekers should be required to work, social benefits should be eliminated, and non-compliant individuals should be deported (196).

> Additional psychopathic solutions could involve building extensive walls beyond Germany/EU borders and preventing marginalized societies from producing atomic bombs by Sanctions.

## "Homo homini lupus" - A man is a wolf to another man, **but not always**?

> In last 2000 years, 70 generations lived, but 33,000 future generations must manage nuclear waste. Is it moral to harm 33,000 generations for one?
  
Due to high morality, concerns after the Fukushima accident, or increased awareness, **Germany has decommissioned its nuclear power plants**, despite other countries still investing in this technology.

The decision to shut down nuclear power plants in Germany has resulted in significant costs, power shortages, and economic losses for its people. (201,202, 203, 204,205,206)
  

## Wait for psychopaths to develop a public utility app, or take action?

An ownerless, non-beneficial group free from hierarchies and sociopathic behavior can brainstorm developement strategies for an ownerless voting app.
