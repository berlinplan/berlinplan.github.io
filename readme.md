#### Does exploitation lead to international inequality?

Exploitation increases the international inequality (22) Tracing the global history of inequality from the Stone Age to today, Walter Scheidel shows that it never dies peacefully. violent shocks reduce inequality. Blanket bombing from the American air fleet and two devastating atomic bombs. led to a decline in social inequality (23)

**Take Benefits by damaging others,psychopathy?**


### What is psychopathy? 
Psychopathy is a serious personality disorder characterized by antisocial behavior, untruthfulness, irresponsibility, and lack of remorse or empathy. (172)

#### Are current political and Economic systems best environment for psychopaths to thrive?

(49) During the past fifty years, psychopaths have gained almost absolute control of all the branches of government (173) based on Germany Population of 84.3 million, approximately 505000 male and 210000 female have Psychopathic profiles, as 15% of prisoners but 21% of CEO’s are Psychopaths, it is considered that there is a big number of successful Psychopaths in big Companies Leadership level and politics (177)

#### Are Psychopathic Systems creating Sociopathic behavior?

psychopaths are born, and sociopaths are created by life experiences. (51) Sociopaths have learned their behavior. They are therefore perfectly capable of feeling emotions, but usually don’t control them. Psychopaths, on the other hand, suffer from a genetic effect.(50)

#### is it possible to keep psychopaths away?

Democracy for 2500 years is the best political system (68) Social hierarchies exist in democracies (64) Since psychopaths have no limitations on what they can or will do to get to the top, all hierarchies inevitably become top-heavy with psychopaths. (79) which turns democracy to Pathocracy (80)
Is it possible to have a Hierarchic system without Psychopaths?
Clinton Callahan says: it is necessary to diagnose psychopathic personalities and keep them out of power. (79) But evidences show: No test is reliable to identify a psychopath (82)
 
#### As we can’t identify Psychopaths, is it Possible to create Systems without Hierarchie?

wer mit dem Teufel essen will, braucht einen langen Löffel (69) He who sups with the devil should have a long spoon (70) Either don't make friends with elephant keepers / or build a house suitable for an elephant, -translation from Persian Poet Saadi (71)

Use Psychopaths Democratic Organisations,  law, Jusiz, Tax Office etc  for their own Interest?
Big Companies have big Legal Departments (73) Lawsuits can be a drain on finances, energy, time, resources, and emotions. (74) if a common man miss a simple bill payment, this can lead him to pay late fees, credit score damage, and other negative financial consequences (75) someone goes to jail if “legal Departments” beat a for cheating (76) While big Companies have the Upper Hand a natural advantage, still Biggest Companies Don't Pay Taxes (77)

Could an App replace Parliamentarians, Presidents, Gouverneur’s and all other Interesting Positions for Psychopaths?

duties of a President: make treaties with the approval of the Senate. veto bills and sign bills. represent nation in talks with foreign countries. enforce the laws that Congress passes. make suggestions about things that should be new laws. lead his political party. entertain foreign guests. recognize foreign countries. grant pardons. (66) The tasks of the parliamentarian are to legislate and control the work of the government. (67)

Who should  pay more in taxes? 
fireman, nursing assistant, teacher? 
or youtuber, instagramer, tik toker, porn performer who damage the society and international equality?
 
Could People have in that App not only Political Voting area, rather Economic area too?
And decide inside the Company that they work how much % each employee gets. instead of wages, direct profit or loss participation?
Example, each person get 1000€ but Peter is a Handworker Guy, is very profitably. Because of him the company make more money every employee Benefits , in the app he can request for himself more shares or people can voluntarily vote to give him more % online. 

Could a Economic section of a voting app  make People effective, awareness, saving energy, be economical and have a work ethic?
Would quality, work ethic, effectiveness, non-wasteful use of resources be extremely high compared to someone who only gets a fix wage in a company?
Companies that are not hierarchic are sustainable for world and environment, as a reward people and decide in the Political Part of app to tax them less, in contrast to other concepts.
 

a Kommunist System, never worked (lazy) but the Most social System in the work (germany) have highest industry quality and production. 

The more you work the more you earn. 

By rightly taxing riches for all damages, can  one Person belongs Tesla, or Amazon etc?
 


Could we have a better Society if we remove the Hierarchic Systems?
 
What is a Society?
Cooperation is really important to human survival. Our ability to cooperate is what allows us to live in big groups. When we live in groups, we can work together. We divide up tasks so that different people can get really good at different things and do them better and more quickly (84)
SOCIETY: people in general thought of as living together in organized communities with shared laws, traditions, and values (83)
How many People in “Modern Societies” would fight if they get attacked by an enemy? Do we have same values?
Example 1: approximately 30,000 fighters from at least 85 countries had joined the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) (85) ISIS had very Clear defined religious Values (86) around 6.6 Milion Syrian (87) 1.5 from Iraq (88) many from Lebanon, Jordan etc. Flee, approaximately 90% Young Muslim Men (89) According to the Qur'an and hadith, to flee from Jihad (war) is a Greater Sin. It is the twenty-seventh sin. (90) added to this, prophet of Islam said: “I disown every Muslim who settles among the mushrikeen” (Christians, Jews) (91) can someone say i am vegan(92) and eat meat everyday?

ISIS Terrorists from 85 countries ->defined value->society. 
And Million Group of people without 1 same Value to fight for it - > society? 
Example 2: US and West spent 20 years and $145 billion in Afghanistan, security forces, civilian government institutions (93) Afghan republic, with all the Weapons, money and Support, fell as soon as US troop left, President Ashraf Ghani fled the capital city by helicopter to neighboring Uzbekistan. Just days earlier, he had sworn never to leave and said that he would die before abandoning his people. because societal values were incompatible with democracy (94) more than 1 million Afghans have fled their country since the Taliban's return (95)
Legit? Taliban Society beated big Group of people without any similar values. 
After Collapse of Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine became an independent state. (96) In 2012 Ernst & Young put Ukraine among the three most-corrupt nations from 43 surveyed, alongside Colombia and Brazil In 2015 The Guardian called Ukraine "the most corrupt nation in Europe “. (97) United States diplomats described Ukraine under Presidents Kuchma and Yushchenko as a kleptocracy according to WikiLeaks cables (98) Prominent Ukrainian economist Oleh Havrylyshyn research estimated the level of the corruption in Ukraine as comparable to countries of Sub-Saharan Africa with Uganda as the closest counterpart. (99) Ukraine's population spends most of its income on cosmetic products (100) The beauty industry is booming and is one of the fastest growing consumer markets, driven in particular by the cosmetics and skincare segments. largest industries and sectors in Ukraine in 2022 from the Datantify database: · 1. Bank · 2. Cafe · 3. Grocery … 10. Beauty 11. Clothing Stores (101) it is forbidden for men aged 18-60, Ukraine citizens, to leave the borders of Ukraine (102) Still, The UNHCR records 8,167,986 refugees from Ukraine across Europe as of 10 April 2023. This amounts to around 20% of the Ukrainian population (103) Per R. Klitgaard Since a high degree of monopoly and low degree of transparency does not automatically lead to corruption, a fourth variable of "morality" or "integrity" has been introduced by others. The moral dimension has an intrinsic component and refers to a "mentality problem" (104) by Martial law Ukrainian Man are force to Participate war, while Russian Army is a Mix of contract und volunteers (105)
Since 8167986 Ukrainian fled, how many would have left the Country if it was not Forbidden for men aged 18-60?

Psychopathical Systems like Sociopaths from all around the World?
Suprise :London : Indians, Pakistanis etc in uk voted for brexit!

euroscepticism within the British South Asian population was stronger than previously anticipated.(197) 


People in Germany: Society? which values they share together?
“human rights” are non-negotiateable Value of EU, BUT: German football team participated World Cup 2022 in Qatar, without wearing “one love” band? (106)
While EU Participating Sanctions because of Abusing Human rights Against many countries (107) How Can Saudi-Arabia be Germany's most important Partner in the MENA region (108)
Europe and Germany seem to have no problem in lecturing to countries like India about democracy, environmentalism, human rights, and demanding their support for Ukraine and other noble causes – and at the same time, deepen business ties with China despite its adventurism in the region and terrible record on human rights and animal welfare. This is not only hypocrisy, it is self-defeating hypocrisy (153)
 Multi-cultirism Leads to tolerant open minded society or paralized parallel societies?
It claims that multi-Culturism is biggest benefit of Migration, leads to Cultural exchange, Tolerance is strengthened, you can learn from each other, Openness to other cultures, new influences - new ideas (110) many studies prove the opposite. Cbm- Two individuals are able to influence each other only if the Distance between their opinion is below a given distance. A bounded confidence model is a model of consensus- like opinion dynamics in which the agents interact with each other only when their opinions are close enough. (111) free circulation of information, social media, political and religious Debates just Push different group to polarization (112) (113) at the Same time people with similar point of view follow, share and comment each other. Liberals follow liberals, conservative follows conservative. (114) discussion of the racial attitude items with others having similar attitudes significantly increased the gap between high- and low-prejudice groups. (115) based on that, extremists who meet and interact between themselves in a mosque, get even more extremist comparing to rising number of mosques in Germany, multi-culturism, raise the gap of Parallel Societies. (116)

Leads Multi-Culturism to International inequality?
(Migration) Multi-Culturism, has Economic benefits, and is necessary for Survival of Western Economy.  2013 Brücker: Germany is biggest winner. Without immigration, the labor force potential in Germany, which currently has 45 million people, would fall by around 40 percent by 2050 (117)
But It seems that people of Country of origins, are biggest loser. Iran Migration Observatory: The migration of every Iranian means the departure of 120,000 dollars from the country. (118) IQ in Origin Country decrease by immigration. SCOTLAND is the least intelligent part of the UK and performs poorly on average IQ against most of Europe, an academic has claimed. (119) Iran Job Vision conducted a survey of "working people" about migration and the result of 6000 valid data is 77% willing to migrate. (120) more than 80% of intelligent Students of Iranian Top University migrate to Western Countries (121)

Per Definition, is multi-Culturism Side effect of a Psychopathic Economy/ pathoconomics?
Multi-Cluturism :polarization & inequality for societies. Big Economic benefits for Companies. 
Benefits of Multi -Culturism: lie?  
 Migration / Slavery / colonization ->  huge Benefits for Psychopathical  Economic.

Has integration really failed in Western Countries?
Sweden: “Integration of migrants has failed” (166)
What is Integration? 
Integration: the act of combining into an integral whole (167)
Combine: implies some merging or mingling with corresponding loss of identity of each unit (168)
80% of top intelligent Students from poor countries ends in big companies in the West. U.S Army is the biggest employer in U.S., Most of Projects and Hi-tech products used or ordered by us Army. (179) operations mostly done in countries like Libya, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia, Pakistan, Sudan (180)
Is a student that leaves his Country to work in a Country, where the Produce of his work, will be Used in his own country not Integrated in the Psychopathic Economics?
A refugee from Pashganistan, flee to Germany, Against the values of Islam, to support the biggest partner of USA. Is he not integrated in the Psychopathic Economics?
 
In a World that it makes 0 Economic difference, if You live and work in pashganista , or in Germany, Would Anyone leave His home, father, mother spend 11000€ and come as refugee to Germany?
Of course, yes 1 who don’t like the pashganistan culture, values, laws, and prefer Western culture-> Would  leave the country. 
But he need Integration? Or already Integrated?
 
How is Cultural Inspiration possible?
political, legal, religious, cultural, social, and economic policy changes Westernizing reforms were achieved under Atatürk's rule (182) In 1698, Tsar Peter I of Russia instituted a beard tax as part of an effort to bring Russian society in line with Western European models. (181) One of many Westernizing actions of Iranian Reza Shah was forcing men to wear Western suits and hats. (183)  Japan Early Westernization & Modernization in Japan. (184)
Why did countries like Russia Turkey, China, iran, Japan etc. made reforms to looks likes western?
Comparisons are a normal part of human cognition and can be good for the self-improvement process. (185)
As the only Value of Psychopathically System is get power and get rich, can we say foreigners are already perfect integrated?
As Western Population, Cultures and Values are vanishing. (186) why should migrants accept German traditions? Would you follow someone who is falling down to valley?
 
 Any  Benefits of Dialogue between different cultures inside one society?
-Debattes-> polarization 
free Information Exchange -> polarization
Dialoge -> polarization 

Polarization ~tribalism on Rise?

https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/the_biology_of_the_modern_political_divide
 
The percentage of people who have friends with different political viewpoints is decreasing. The odds of you marrying someone with a different political orientation are also down. I think that reflects the ways in which social media have made this such a polarizing atmosphere.
 
For example, devout religious belief is not a predictor of extremism. Devout religious observance isn’t either. But devout religious observance in a group setting is. Studies show that support for terrorism in majority Muslim countries is unrelated to how often you pray, or how devout you are about food prohibitions. But it is related to how often you pray in a mosque. The same is also true of right-wing Jewish extremists in Israel. When sacred values are re-affirmed in groups—that’s when things get scary.
 
We’re also seeing the rise of nationalism all around the world, and with that has come an increased tolerance for autocratic leaders. This is often explained as a reaction to globalization: If McDonald’s is everywhere, people feel a threat to their national identity, and they feel a need to affirm it in a strong, even belligerent way. Do you agree?
 
https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/what_is_the_true_cost_of_polarization_in_america
https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_inequality_is_bad_for_the_one_percent
 
This research suggests it’s bad for everyone’s well-being when the rich don’t have contact with the poor, or the poor with the middle class.

Beauty Operations, dating, Pickup & Alpha masculinity Coaches, hook up & Ghost culture, Style coaches, online dating Profile Designer etc Side effects of growing psychopathic Platforms?
Dating Apps have millions of users (55) 95% of females wants to date only 5% of men (56) the is new Standard of dating Culture (hook up culture) (58) Number of Alpha /Pick up Coaches is rising (57) PUA Coaches Promote their customers by using Psychological Tricks and Manipulations techniques to sleep with as more women as possible (60)
 
Leads Psychopathic Dating Plattforms to internationale inequality?
Online Dating increase sexual activity (62) Multiple Sexual Activity Is Linked to Higher Turnover Rates Among Sexual Partners (61) which decrease Birthrates (13) that causes Ageing Population (14)
Dating Apps empower woman or disempower woman?
online dating app Bumble claims to empower women and promote equality. (150)

Online dating, Tinder etc best  Environment for psychopaths to Grow?
The psychopath frequently engages in promiscuous sexual behavior or has many short-term marital relationships (59) Sociopathic behavior is rising (53)

Leads Dating APPs to Open relationships/ Polygamy then to Polygyny?
In Dating Apps top 5% men have “access” to 95% females (56) Dating Apps increase sexual Activity (62), Open relationships are on the rise (149) polygamy leads to Polygyny: males exhibit renewed sexual interest whenever a new female is introduced, while Females are not influenced by the Coolidge Effect (146)
Other studies: “…In two experimental studies that employed different manipulations, we found converging evidence that men showed a greater preference for variety in potential short-term mates than did women.” (151)
Another study: “--The experimental design involved a setup similar to the dating app Tinder… men selected more potential sex partners than the women did” (152)
 
Polygamy aka. Polygyny empowers or abuse Woman as Modern Barbarism?
“Arguments that many women favor polygyny and should be free to choose it assume that in polygynous societies women would be free to choose their husbands. They assume that women’s far stronger rights, status, and freedoms in monogamous societies and traditions don’t depend upon monogamy”. (147)
Effects on women
• Women in polygynous societies have low status and less freedom than women in monogamous societies.
• Co-wives must compete with each other for love, sex, and money, and for education, inheritances, and paternal care and attention for their children. One study report, “Co-wife conflict is ubiquitous in polygynous households.
• Polygynous wives suffer more violence and abuse. The age gap between polygynous husbands and their younger wives often increases marital conflict.
• The shortage of women in polygyny forces men to seek younger and younger wives. Women’s average age at marriage is 10 years younger than in monogamy, they are much younger when they first give birth, and they have a wider marital age gap.
• Early marriage and child-bearing contribute heavily to poorer mental and physical health for women—more depression, nervous breakdowns, and higher mortality and shorter lives than monogamous women.
Effects on children
• Children in polygynous relationships receive much less paternal attention and care. Polygyny reduces a man’s investment of time and resources in each of his more numerous offspring. One man with several wives and a lot of children can’t give any of them the time and attention a monogamous man can give each member of his family. (So far, Kody Brown seems to have 18 children. FLDS recommends that each man takes at least three wives; its leaders sometimes have staggering numbers—for example, Canadian FLDS leader Winston Blackmore has 150 children by 27 wives.)
• Excess boys have been abandoned or forced out of some fundamentalist Mormon communities.
• Children in polygynous families suffer more abuse, neglect, and violence than those in monogamous families, and have more physical, emotional, and behavioral problems.
• Infant mortality is much higher in polygynous than in comparable monogamous societies. Within polygynous societies, children in monogamous families also have lower mortality rates than those in polygynous families. In 19th century American polygyny, the children of poor men’s monogamous marriages had significantly better survival rates than the children of rich polygynists.
Effects on men
• Polygyny, even at low-sounding percentage rates, creates a shortage of unmarried women and an excess of unmarried men. In a simple society of 100 people, suppose only three out of 50 men (or six percent) are polygynous. Suppose two of them have three wives each and the third, a very rich man, has 10. That means those three men marry 32 percent of the women, leaving just 34 for the remaining 47 men. Over a quarter of the men will have no wives. Even these modest levels of polygyny are sometimes exceeded in real life. In Burkina Faso and Nigeria, 36 percent and 28 percent of households, respectively, are polygynous; in Togo 54 percent of married women are in polygynous marriages. Some United States polygynous communities have had very high rates.
 
• Polygyny creates intense male competition for mates. In polygynous societies, all married men are still in the marriage market because they can always marry more wives. In a monogamous society, once a man marries, he exits the competition.
 
• In polygynous societies, competition among men for mates motivates male control over their sisters, daughters, and wives. Sisters and daughters can be traded for a new wife or for money, goods, labor, favors, and political or military support from other men. To consolidate these deals, they need the power to force the girls and women to marry. Polygynous husbands may seek control over their wives so as to compel their labor, and also because their wives’ sexual opportunities with them are limited compared to those of monogamous women’s. Young wives, meanwhile, may prefer young men to old husbands.
• In societies where women and children are important as laborers for their husbands and fathers—as they often are in polygynous relationships in the United States—competition for wives increases, creating a larger number of unmarried males.
 
• Unmarried men in both polygynous and monogamous societies commit far more crimes than married men. Having a wife reduces the chance that a man will commit a crime by half. (Unmarried cohabitation doesn’t reduce crime.)
• A study in Malawi found that polygynous husbands had more extramarital affairs than monogamous husbands.
 
Respecting values -> stable Relationships -> sustainability ->equality. 
By having defined values aka. Religion -> Reach Equality?
Monogamy is the only consistent relationship for men, woman and children, values to keep a relationship stable and long: very similar to religious Values.
Is Consistent Freedom -> a Freedom that not damage others?

defined values/relegion the most POSSIBLE consistent kind of Freedom for man and Woman?


The Most Freedom for he/She in church /islam? 
-an app could solve the institunal Problem of relegion or Create New values Groups

Transgender people in Woman Sport competitions, Moraly right? (193)
Before Discuss about Transgender. ->
How fair are Sport competitions? (penis (length) comparison.)
Aka. Why pashganistan are always losers?
USA, Germany, China -> proud of Win all golden medal in the last 30 years. 
If an pashganistan Athlete was borned in China or Russia got the right Doping, (194) Training from early ages , and Chinese Athlete was Born in pashganistan, What Would Happend? 

pashgan athelete in international competition -> lose as shit 99% 

Pathocracy athelete in international competition-> Win -> increased proud, self-esteem, National feelings  

 How healthy are this competition? 
In short, the excessive stress on muscles, bones, tendons and ligaments associated with sports specialization has been linked to a greater risk of overuse injuries. Overuse, which accounts for about half of the injuries seen in young athletes, happens gradually and gets worse over time.
 
What are the other Problems?
1 Money and marketing: to grow, sports adapted to television formats and some lost a lot of fun because of it.
2 Big athletes are big moneymakers and with it comes sponsors and cia demanding them be someone who they aren't. Their personalities are built by marketing.
3 Match-fixing and doping: are sports results legitimate?
4 People want to watch the best of the best all the time; most championships and tournaments of lower levels of most sports are not profitable nor can pay themselves solely with ticket sales (193)

Possiblity of beta or Pilot project. In a Village of 100 people?
 
-less Hierarchic /Ideological Armies Like Taliban /Iranian irgc/ Isis stronger or Classic Armies?
 
If Parents get voting Power of their Children-> solve  Environment Problem?

-the half-lives of some of radioisotopes produced are greater than a million years. 
Should we give children (over Parents) voting Power? 
 
App->Destroy Psychopathical Systems ->equality -> No Mass Migration -> less Flights -> good Environment -> societies with similar values  melt -> No borders -> no Investment in Armies
 
e-car->maybe good for Environment -> Create huge inequality -> Atomic war -> bad for Environment? 

Electric cars would need ten times as many chips as petrol or diesel (140) Joe Biden passed the Chips Act. This states that no US technology may be used in the production of semiconductors with a structure width of less than 14 nanometers. (139)
They don’t sell the Technologies to any countries, but the Produces Chips. To Make highest Profit. Which means poor countries soon have to Import this Technology. Money brings Intelligence, intelligent people Make more Money.  Inside the country the rich get richer Like international Level  the rich country get richer and the poor, poorer.
 
Would Economic Sanctions, brain drain,  Migration of youth,  negativ handle Balance.  Corroupt psychopathic goverment pushes a society to "international violent shock"?

Which is the correct Solution? 
solve Environment Issues -> Block streets?activity Instagram? get Position in Psychopathical System, collect Follower, Money, popoularity?

Or solve Environment Issues -> equality -> including losers in voting ->children via Parents 
loser countries via Oversociety? 


Which Options is There to reduce inequality?
1. Non psychopathic app for political, Economic, value, Environmental equality?
2. Violent shock, big enough to destroy inequality and do action 1 to Keep it?

 Since 1960 inequality is Rising in the World (138), the only way to destroy inequality is "violent shock"

Why egoism is the best Solution? 
 
• A real egoist - don’t want inequality in World, because he is self-centered and don’t like to get atomic bomb on His Head.
• A real egoist - even in a country wants to have equality. Then the only way to live in a long term Safe and clean area without Revolutions etc.
• A real egoist - Not Drinking Alk, cigarette, avoid multiple sexual Activity, avoid consumption of porn,social Media, avoid polluting Environment.
• A real egoist - Bound himself to values for Create a Family and avoid Import. Workers from other countries, because it Makes the World inequal?
• A real egoist avoids multi-cultirism in the Form of psychopathic Systems because it leads to inequality! Parallel societies! And conflicts.


How near is Atomic war?

2013 Gallup Iran poll: Which of following groups do you hold most responsible for sanctions against Iran? (165)46% The U.S 16% don´t know 13% The Iranian government 12% UN and EU.

Why psychopathic Leaders Would never use Atom bombs?

Psychopaths are not crazy. They are fully aware of what they do and the consequences of those actions.(195)
 
2013 Iran's religious Leader Khamenei says building, using nuclear bomb is forbidden under religion (154) he used his special religious Power and made a non-changeable Islamic rule on it Haram-fatwa (178) Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the most Popular Iranian President who was pushing nuclear development program 'disqualified' from every Iran’s election since 2013 (162)
 
Iran Poll Jul 2022: 54% of Iranian think developing nuclear weapons is against the teachings of Islam. (163)
2023 Iran religious Leader Khamenei says: he opposes holding referendum because 'not all people have the power to analyze the issue' proposed for a vote (164)
 While ordinary people wants Atomic Bomb. Leaders dont want. 

Psychopathical religious Leaders invent Islamic law to forbid it?
Atomic War ->equality
Psychopathical Political and Religious Leaders -> gain or lose Power?

What is more possible?

Kim Jong-un (North Korean Supreme Leader)/Khamenei (Iranian Supreme Leader)
use atomic bomb.

Or 
Idealogical - equal - value based Group Like Al-qaida?, ISIS? Whatever With New Developing Technologies, 3D printer etc. Build and Use atom bomb? 


People wants Atom bomb. to kill others or it is an inequality thing?
 (~80% Because others have it)
Poll as Jul.2022: Why do you think Iran should develop atomic bombs? (On Pro bomb voters) (163)
• 33.8% to prevent others from attacking Iran
• 14.1% Because countries with nuclear weapons are threatening Iran
• 13.2% To show our power
• 10.5% Because other countries have it
• 7.2% to increase our defense capabilities
• 5.4% it would increase our security
• 4.5% don’t know


Why a Terrorist See innocent people living in a psychopathical System as enemy? 

Example 1  :
Imagine You are Inside your home in Your Village in pashganistan, your home get Bombed by some psychopathical Military Armies. (By mistake or for spread democracy etc) Your Family got killed. 
Who is guilty? 
Only the bomb itself? 
The Pilot is guilty?
 Airplane? 
The Company that Produces semi-conductor for that airplane Company?
 
The Döner kebab-seller who feed the Workers in the Company that Produces Tools that are used in the Company of semi cundoctor Company? 
 
 
Example 2: 
You live in pashganistan. Psychopathical System makes sanctions on Your country. Google Support that System and delete all Your Banking, Taxi etc apps from Android. A Youtube Video Creator for peace love and climate, YT runned by Google, which Make sanctions => inequality? 


How much a pashganistani  Benefits from luxury elektro Cars /NASA traveller Or super Yachts?

You work in a Microchip Producer Company, that could be used in highest super Computers, best luxury elektro Cars, Air space and in Rockets and Aircrafts and drones that ONLY get used in Afghanistan, iran, iraq some times in  Syria, north Korea, Sudan.
If the VOTE of pashganistanis get Counted, could we Then See if you help Them or not? 

High Tech.
If societies Decide - they could Invest to Invest in Laboratories how - Technologies

 if psychopathical Entertainments are reduced. What to do in free time? 
-Time to play and educate children -instead of tik tok Instagram sexualsation?

Start to Produce food instead of letting Avocado shipped from 10000km?

Clean the damage of last years?


Sociopaths  Solution could work ? 

Boris Palmer : with the abolition of social benefits, forcing asylum seekers to work and sending the bad ones back home.(196) or other Solution : Brexit : Indians, Asian in uk voted pro brexit (197)
Aka. Import good and Most healthy Workers. The bad ones get dipprted to countries of origin
 
-as the Next step Would be meaningful Building big Walls outside Germany /EU. 

-Make sure that pashganistan never build Atomic bombs, pashganistan have psychopathical System that never use Them. 


Question : What if a little Group out side of Power in pashganistan Create an app, totaly equality, and by Developing Technologie 3D Printer etc in 10/20 years build an underground Atom bomb?
------
Is Europa Like USA out of Radar?
Importing good Workers, send bad ones back, build Walls, sanctions Make more inequality,  push "pashganistan loser society more want to use Atomic bomb " to have the highest Range of equality After using some. Is more dangerous for europe or USA?

 -pay 10/20€ per year for a Website to a concern Make the World more inequal. As all other ways has more damage, this is the Moraly Better instead of Create Money making Youtube Instagram etc. 

If the society in Future votes that having a Website is the highest damage Compare to non psychopathic Plattforms available in Future Then this Website Would be immoral. 


Compensation calculation : 
 
8 hours approach work Daily (10 min/ Person.)
